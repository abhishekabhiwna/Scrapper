# Scrapper

### What is web scraping used for?
Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, 
web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

I used Scrapy to scrap the Amazon website.

An open source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites.
In a fast, simple, yet extensible way.
